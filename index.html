 <h2>Aaliyah Reid</h2>
 <p>Hey, there! Iâ€™m Aaliyah Reid, I was born and raised in St. James, Jamaica.
    Currently, I'm in my second year of university, working towards a bachelor's degree in computer science. While my
    initial plan was to major in biochemistry, I discovered
    a passion for programming on my own and have not regretted my decision ever since. I view myself as a
    creative as I am also very passionate about the arts. I've taken a keen interest in full-stack web development 
    because it will allow me to blend my design skills with programming, creating the perfect outlet for both my passions.</p>
